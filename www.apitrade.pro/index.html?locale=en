                                            <h5><p>Crypto currency - to this date it is the safest way to transfer funds with no limits or third parties involved.<br /><br />As you may have already noticed, when you deposit hard earned money to a checking account in the bank, usually a bank starts to treat this money as if it wasn't yours any more. At any moment a bank can freeze your account, request more information in regards to your account, put a hold/stop on a requested transfer, charge you all kinds of fees without prior notice. If at any moment one bank decides that you are not entitled to have an account with them for whatever reason there is, your name will be added to a ChexSystems (nationwide specialty consumer reporting agency under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, so called BlackList) and most other existing banks will deny you an account with them. Bank can go bankrupt and there is very little chance you will get you money from FDIC. Even if you do, it's going to take forever. Fees that banks put onto merchants are often above 2.5% per each swipe you do with your card, this makes merchants lose a huge stake of their income. If you ever decide to send money overseas, banks will often ask you for some sort of paperwork a fee of at least $45 and in case the transfer is accepted by the bank it's going to take few business days for this transfer to arrive. Thus, traditional banking system has too many limitations and unfortunately there are more and more limitations are implemented each year.<br /><br />Everything is different when it comes to crypto currencies: your transfer goes directly to the intended party with no third parties involved, nobody can freeze your account, your transfer can not get lost (unless you made a mistake in details of the transfer) because anybody can track it through the blockchain (public database of all transfers that can not be altered in any way). Transfers using crypto currency are almost instantaneous, very cheap and have no limitations. It is especially convenient to make transfers to people and organizations in other countries. Advantages for average Joe and businesses are obvious! Therefore, we are very confident that the crypto currency market will grow as more people start using it and appreciate its advantages (according to our research, large number of payments towards Chinese suppliers are done via crypto currencies, especially in Bitcoin, and this number is growing exponentially). <br /><br /><strong>Bitcoin</strong> is the first and main crypto currency, a <strong>de facto</strong> standard, recognized throughout the world. Bitcoin is the entry point to the crypto currency market for most new users. Due to the fact that the number of issued coins is limited (21 million), and the demand for it is constantly growing, its price growth in a long run is inevitable. Of course, Bitcoin market may be losing half of its value from time to time, that is happening because the market is young and its capitalization is low. Most downfalls are triggered by high stake market players, who are looking to get more Bitcoins at a lower price by artificially creating an panic (if price would constantly go up, nobody would be willing to sell their coins), banks and governments. Whatever they do to make Bitcoin more volatile and slow the its popularity growth, it will make no sense. Such volatility makes ApiTrade make you more money in the shorter term.<br /><br />Over the past year due to the technology constantly improving, Bitcoin transfers have become fast and almost free. This has a favorable effect on demand for bitcoins.<br /><br />As for other crypto currencies, many of them have unique features that also increase its popularity. For example, Ethereum (ETH) supports smart-contracts, it is an entry point for all investors into ICO (new way to attract private funds) therefore its price is going to grow overtime due to an increased demand for the coin.</p></h5>

As you already know crypto-currency market is very volatile, ApiTrade will use this volatility to make you money.. <br /><br />Here just a few useful features ApiTrade can offer:<br /><br />1) <strong>Auto trading mode and Arbitrage</strong> - may be turned on with a single click with no further adjustments required, will be automatically increasing the number of your coins in all of your accounts on the popular exchanges by high-speed trading, making thousands of small low-risk transactions. You benefit from the volatility of the crypto-market, regardless of its growth or decline.<br /><br /> 2) <b>Manual trading mode</b> - trade crypto on multiple exchanges at the same time from a single browser window (no need to log into each exchange) at the best rates, ApiTrade automatically detects an exchange with the lowest prices for the asset/coin you are interested in. Our platform will automatically analyze exchange rates on 25 crypto-exchanges and find the best prices for those currencies you are interested in. It is very often that the price of a coin may differ on each exchange and this difference may be up to 4-10%.<br />To profit from these price differences you will need to purchase a coin on one exchange (making sure it has no withdrawal problems), send it to the other exchange (making sure that deposits for this coin are accepted), then sell a coin at a higher price.If you have this coin at both exchanges, there will be no need to transfer it between exchanges. At this moment an automated conduct for such transactions is available for three main exchanges, all other exchanges will have to be handled manually.<br /><br /> 3) <strong>Deposit funds to any exchange</strong> (not currently offered). We understand that the most common issue most beginner crypto investors are faced with is the complexity to purchase coins, outrageous fees charged by exchanges and high risk of fraud. This is why we are working to make your life easier by offering a one-click solution to deposit funds into an exchange of your choice at lowest rates and zero risk. All deposits will be processed instantly.</p></h5>

This means anyone, whether beginner or advanced, can use ApiTrade without having any prior knowledge or experience with professional trading. Instead of displaying lots of settings/parameters, we automatically tune them for automated trade based on the automatic analysis of efficiency and machine learning. You can  switch off some algorithms, as well as add certain coins to blacklist (we already have a global blacklist of questionable/scammy coins in our system to ignore). Our default settings are optimal from the start and you don't have to change anything. <br><br>Our users don't have any difficulties when using the service, but some of them have difficulties when registering at each cryptocurrency exchange, buying bitcoins at each exchange, many users also have difficulties with verification process on exchanges. With this in mind, we plan to offer solutions to simplify these processes (ideally - sign up at all exchanges with a single click at ApiTrade, recharge your balance in all exchanges with a click).</h5>

2) Register a separate account in <a href=https://www.binance.com/?ref=21901959 target=_blank>Binance</a> (recommended).<br>
3) Provide access to the API keys from the exchange. 
(for more details, see the FAQ section "Exchanges" - "how to get API keys")<br>
4) Make a deposit to your account in Binance for a sum of at least 0.1 BTC <br>
5) Add at least $10 to Apitrade balance or ask support for a bonus (use ticket).<br>
6) Enable algorithms in the "Algorithms" section
 <br> <br> We recommend that you create separate accounts on exchanges specifically for using with the ApiTrade service (we don't recommend to perform trades in these accounts using other services or manually, because it can lead to errors). Always use different passwords in each exchange and enable  2FA Auth for security purposes.<br><br>You can search for "Apitrade" on Youtube and find hundreds of videos made by our users where they show how to get started with Apitrade.</h5>

                                            <h5>Some new users do not believe in the screenshots of incomes, which are published by thousands of our current users in social networks, telegram chats, youtube videos, and they want to check for themselves that the service is working and makes profit. However, most people do this <b> incorrectly </b>. For example, they transfer different coins to the exchange, turn on the system and look at the estimated value of the deposit in dollars or btc on the exchange. When they see that at some point the estimated value is decreasing, they think that the robot is loosing money , not realizing that the estimated value of the deposit in dollars or btc on the exchange does not show the system's efficiency in any way, but basically shows a change of exchange rates of the original currencies that the user has chosen. The system increases the number of initial coins, but can not affect their current market rates in dollars or bitcoin. <br> <br> We offer the easiest way to verify that the system really works: <br> <br>
<b> 1) If you want to increase the deposit in bitcoins (the most popular and effective option!): </b> Make a deposit to your Binance account of at least 0.1 BTC (less deposit will be sufficient only for one or two trading pairs, the result may be, in many ways, random) and run the "Waves" and "Chains" algorithms. In this case look at the estimated value of the deposit only in BTC, not in dollars. The "Waves" algorithm buys altcoins when their price decreases. First your balance in exchange will decrease, it is absolutely normal and is an indicator that the bot is actively buying. Soon it will sell with profit and your balance will increase. Stay patient and let the robot work. <br> <br>
<b> 2) If you want to increase the deposit in ETH: </b> Make a deposit to your Binance account of at least 1.5 ETH (less deposit will be sufficient only for one or two trading pairs, the result may be, in many ways, random) and run algorithms "Waves" and "Chains". In this case look at the estimated value of the deposit should only in ETH, not in dollars or btc. The "Waves" algorithm buys altcoins when their price decreases. First your balance in ETH will decrease, it is absolutely normal and is an indicator that the bot is actively buying. Soon it will sell with profit and your balance will increase. Stay patient and let the robot work. <br> <br>
<b> 3) If you want to increase the deposit in dollars </b> (not very effective, as there are few trading pairs on the exchange): Put at least 1000 USDT on Binance (less than 1-2 trade pairs and less the result will be random) and run the "Waves" and "Rings" algorithms. In this case look at the estimated value of the deposit should only in USDT, not in BTC. The "Waves" algorithm buys coins when their price decreases. First your balance in USDT will decrease, it is absolutely normal and is an indicator that the bot is actively buying. Soon it will sell with profit and your balance will increase. Stay patient and let the robot work.<br><br> In the system, the estimated value of the deposit is calculated more accurately than on the exchange. On the exchange, it is calculated at a discounted price with an instant "panic" sale which may be 5-10% lower than the maximum price for this coin today, and often without taking into account the small tails of coins ("dust"). <br><br>
We do not recommend to deposit <b>several different coins </b> at the exchange because in this case you will not be able to evaluate the result. It is not worth trying to deposit altcoins for the test, since there are usually only 2 trading pairs on exchanges, the efficiency will be lower. <br> <br> In the system, the estimated value of a deposit is shown at average purchase prices without profit. This is slightly less than the sum you will actually receive after all coins will be sold. At the exchange, at first you may see a <b> decline in the virtual balance </b> in the first days of testing the system  (or during periods of market collapses), this is normal, because there are active purchases of coins, the commission of the exchange has been deducted, but there are a lot of unfinished transactions, the profit from which has not yet been received, but the absolute majority of transactions are successfully completed within 14 days because the market is very volatile. If you want to see the exact figure of the deposit on the exchange, you need to press the "Pause" button and wait until all open trades are closed.</h5>

The service will finish the old trades with profit, regardless of whether you replenish the balance. <br>
<b>Refund and pay-out policy</b>: for security reasons, payment of funds from the balance of the service (including compensations) is not made, except for two cases: <br> <br>
1) Payment of affiliate commission for referral program <br>
2) Refunds of transfers made by error, for which, like the coinpayments service, our service charges "8% recovery fee" for manual processing. Payment made by error is replenishment of the balance of service instead of exchange balance. The warning is written in bold text on the page of replenishment. All such transfers made by error must be reported to the tickets within <b>7 days after payment</b>, specifying a purse for a refund. The refund is made in the same currency and at the same rate as at the time of payment.
<br> <br>
If you are not sure whether you need to replenish the service - ask for a bonus for testing, wait for the completion of old trades without replenishing the account, and replenish the service account from the profit received on the exchange. You do not need to replenish the service for large amounts - more than 1-5% of your deposit on the exchange.<br><br>

                                            <h5><p>ApiTrade's main rule is to never lose money!<br /><br />We will never place stop-loss orders. We will never execute losing sell orders.</p>
<p>Our arbitrage algorythms involve instant transactions. Platform will increase the number of initially deposited coins over time.</p>
<p>ApiTrade will constantly increase the number of initially deposited coins. Very low percentage of all trades (usually 5-10%) executed at the market price will be negative due to delays in order executions coming from exchanges, but our system will automatically compensate 50% of every loss.</p>
<p>Our "waves" algorithm is using the volatility within a single trading pair and exchange. When this algo is set to "ON", ApiTrade will be buying a coin when everyone is selling at the lowest price possible, and sell the coin at the highest possible price, when everyone is loading up. In case coin price falls then ApiTrade:</p>
<p>1) will be buying more of this coin as its price goes lower (using a dynamic martingale, that changes according to the price falling speed), so that the average purchase price is lower.<br /><br /> 2) will lower profit expectations if needed so that the final trade completes faster.</p>
<p>3) may use this coin for arbitrage, echanging it onto other coins back and forth so that the number of the given coin is increasing over time.<br /><br />The logic behind ApiTrade is that coin should be working to make you profits, no matter small or large.</p>
<p>In case you decide to get rid of the coin, you may go ahead and sell it manually at a loss, but we do not recommend doing so. Crypto market is very volatile, therefore a price for each coin may go up at any time. You will see "Panic sell" button (with 50% compensation) in case 100 days from the first purchase of a coin has passed and the price is still not enough to close the deal with profit.</p></h5>

<p>1) <strong>Add more supported exchanges</strong>, in this case the probability to locate better prices is higher<br /><br />2) <strong>Add more funds to each exchange</strong>. It is often that you don't have enough funds on an exchange to do trading, so you may be missing the chance to profit.&nbsp;In order to do trading on some of the most profitable algorithms, large deposits are required.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Diversify your deposits</strong>. Get more coins that have the most trading pairs, such as BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB (Binance Coin) to increase the possibility for arbitrage.&nbsp;However, there is a depreciation risk for the currency in which you hold funds. ApiTrade is not responsible for such actions, therefore you should be&nbsp;carefully considering all pros and cons of any coin your are transferring your funds into. ApiTrade will use your initial deposit to generate profits, initial distribution of the deposit is on you.<br /><br />4) <strong>Fund your ApiTrade balance.</strong>&nbsp;We recommend you fund the balance by 5-10% of all combined deposits you hold at each exchange. In case your balance is low, ApiTrade may be disregarding some trades that you could potentially profit from.</p>
<p>5) <strong>Lower exchange rates</strong>. Some exchanges we work with (Binance, Huobi, Kucoin), offer large discounts on trading fees (up to 50%). These discounts may be saving you thousands of dollars in fees. Please make sure you read through all the rules provided by each exchange and use the information at your own advantage.</p>

                                            <h5><p>As an example, let's take a look at three popular exchanges currently working with ApiTrade:<br /><br /> 1) <strong>Binance</strong>: In the user interface go to "Account" and click the "API Settings" button. Enter any name in the provided field and hit the "Create New Key" button. Copy API Key + Secret and paste it into your ApiTrade account when asked to do so. Make sure trading is enabled for the API-Key you are using with ApiTrade service, click the "Save" button and you are ready to go.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Huobi: </strong>In the user interface point your mouse coursor onto your login credentials and click "API Management" menu. Enter any name in the provided field and hit the "Create". Copy API Key + Secret and paste it into your ApiTrade account. API-Key will expire in 3 months from the date it was created, don't forget to create new key once the old one is expired. Click the "Confirm" button. Also, make sure you have enabled 2-Factor Authentication in the "Account and security" sertion of your Huobi account for security purposes.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Kucoin:</strong> In the user interface go to "Account" and click the "API Keys" button. Hit the "Create" button. Copy API Key + Secret and paste it into your ApiTrade account and you are all set to go. Important: at this moment Kukoin allowes coin withdrawal via API and there is no way to set limitations on that. Therefore, we do not recommend using Kukoin's API with any kind of services out there for security reasons.</p></h5>

    as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate
    a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect
    or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.<br><strong>What personal information do we collect from the people

    offer third-party products or services on our website.<br><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong><br>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation
    to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.  The laws reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company
    in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a
    conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. -

    important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking<br><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong>When it comes to the
    collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.  The
    Federal Trade Commission, United States consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must
    do to protect childrens privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old and do not let third-parties, including
    ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13<br><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong><br>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the
    backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
    globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
    personal information.<br>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will
    notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days.
